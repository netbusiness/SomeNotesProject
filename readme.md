#Instructions

1. Check out the repository

2. Get [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) if you have not already

3. Run `composer install` from the root folder (may have to run `composer update` instead on a non-windows machine)

4. Setup web server document root for `/public`

5. Open `.env.example`. Make the necessary config changes and save as `.env`. Do not overwrite the example.

6. May have to open up write permissions to `/storage` folder recursively.

7. Import `example.sql` into your database to get a starting point.
